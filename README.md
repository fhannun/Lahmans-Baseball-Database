# Lahmans-Baseball-Database
This database contains pitching, hitting and field statistics from 1871-2018. The primary goal of this project is to determine who the overall top five players of any given year were and provides insight on statistics for certain players. The dashboard contains two pages, one for RBI's (Runs batted in) and one for triples.
